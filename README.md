# Purchase Management System

Welcome to the Purchase Management System repository. This project is a simple purchase management system using credit cards, developed in Java. It allows users to register purchases, check the available balance, and view a list of purchases made, ordered by value. The project contains three main classes: `Main`, `Purchase`, and `CreditCard`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

### Packages and Files

- **Principal:** Contains the main class that manages the execution of the program.
  - `Main.java`: Implements the interactive menu and manages the purchase flow.
- **Model:** Contains the classes responsible for purchase registration and credit card management.
  - `Purchase.java`: Represents a purchase, including description and value.
  - `CreditCard.java`: Checks the available balance and registers purchases.

## Functionalities

- **Register Purchases:** The user can register multiple purchases, providing the description and value of each purchase.
- **Check Balance:** The system automatically checks whether there is sufficient balance on the credit card before registering a purchase.
- **List Purchases:** At the end of the operations, the system displays a list of all purchases made, ordered by value.
- **Card Limit:** The user defines the credit card limit when starting the program, and the available balance is managed automatically.

## Usage

Here is an example to guide you through the process of using the Purchase Management System:

### Main Menu

When starting the program, you will be greeted with the main menu. Select the desired option to register a new purchase, check the balance, or list all purchases made.

### Register Purchases
